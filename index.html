<h1 style="color:#222222; font-family: Georgia, Garamond, Serif; text-align: center;">The Willow</h1>
<h2 style="color:#70D6FF; font-family: Georgia, Garamond, Serif; text-align: center;">By: Freeman Edwin Miller</h2>

<p style="text-align: center; color:#FF9FB2;">A song for the willow, the wild weeping willow,<br/>That murmurs a dirge to the rapturous days,<br/>And moans when the kiss of the breeze laden billow<br/>Entangles and dangles among the sad sprays!<br/>A musical ditty to scatter the sadness,<br/>A warble of wildness to banish its tears,<br/>Till tremulous measures of bountiful gladness<br/>Be sounding and bounding through all of the years.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color:#FF9FB2;">The beautiful brooks, as they waken from slumbers,<br/>Pause under the shadows that fall from the boughs,<br/>And weave their caresses in passionate numbers,<br/>While soothing and smoothing the frowns from its brows;<br/>But chained in the desolate sorrows of weeping<br/>Its heart never warms to the raptures of mirth,<br/>And over its bosom no pleasures are creeping<br/>While wending and blending their joys with the earth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color:#FF9FB2;">Then sing for the willow, the wild weeping willow,<br/>That droops in the smiles of the summer-born times,<br/>And mourns in the kiss of the sweet-scented billow,<br/>When beaming and gleaming are dripping with chimes!<br/>While melodies move where their happiness lingers,<br/>They surely will gladden the tear-laden sprays,<br/>And music that flutters from fairy-like fingers<br/>Will lighten and brighten the burdensome days.</p>
